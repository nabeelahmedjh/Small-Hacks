    Small Hacks is a platform that will help you assist in your small task such
    as generating a strong password that will protect your accounts on internet
    and it has a wonderful tech community where people can share their point of
    views about the technologies related to computers. Itâ€™s still in beta mode
    and there are only two hacks available on it for now. For sure it will be
    updated in future.
