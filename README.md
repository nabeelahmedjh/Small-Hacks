# **CS50 Final Project**

#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/kB8_8xuksRE

#### Description: Small Hacks is a platform that will help you assist in your small task such as generating a strong password that will protect your accounts on internet and it has a wonderful tech community where people can share their point of views about the technologies related to computers. It’s still in beta mode and there are only two hacks available on it for now. For sure it will be updated in future.

## Welcome to CS50 final project by Nabeel Ahmed.

It was an honor for me to study Harvard level education for free.

### My project is a web application made on front-end technologies and backend with flask and database with SQL. The name of my project is Small Hacks.

## _Below are the main features for my project:_

---

## **1. login/logout/register system:**

#### The login, logout and register system is inspired by the problem set 9 of CS50 i.e., Finance. The working of these routes is implemented with SQL table called users where every registered user is stored with a unique id and a hash of its password. The register route is little interesting because it contains a validate password function which will validate the password at the time of registration on the basic of standard internet password requirements.

## **2. Hacks:**

#### For now, there are only two hacks generate password and validate password. The generate password is the first small hack of my web app it will assist users into having a strong security password. The generate password is implemented on a function which will generate a password on the standard requirements for browsers these days. The 2nd hack is validate password which will let users type a password and validate it on the standard requirements of browsers.

## **3. Community:**

#### This feature of my web app is the interesting one and my favorite as well, its basically a little article blog feature where users will post not only reviews about the Small Hacks but also write blogs and tech information about the CS industry. Users a can interact with one another by publishing their post and make the Small Hacks community great. The working of it is implemented on a SQL table called Post where each post publish by user is saved and then at the index page all the post by different people can be seen in reverse chronological order. Users can also check their own post just like a mini profile in reverse chronological order as well.

#### The implementation of this project is straight forward I have used CS50 library for running queries into my database and bunch of other libraries which supports me making this project possible.

#### So, it’s been my Final project of CS50. It’s been a great journey of CS50x, I have learned a lot in these past couple of months what really matters is now I’m able to think logically and because CS50 being my first intro to programming course it gives me a lot. Thank you CS50, the team and the one and only thanks to Mr. David J. Malan for making this amazing course free for everyone.
